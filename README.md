# Knight Tour Problem Visualization

This solution solves the knight tour problem using Warnsdorff's Algorithm for knight tour.

## Installation
No installation needed, just run index.html file

## Demo
1. You can find [demo](https://knight-tour.netlify.com/) here 
2. To run it, click a square, and follow the indicator for the next step

## Notes
1. For now, the board is 8x8, but in knight.js file, if you edit the number n on top of the file, you can change the board size.
The same goes for canvas size.

2. The number on top left of each sqaure represents the possible moves if you are in that square

3. The number on the bottom right of each square represents the current value of that block, 0 if not visited, 1 if visited.
