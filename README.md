## Installation
No installation needed, just run index.html file

## Demo
You can find demo here [Demo](https://labibismaiel.github.io/knightTour/)
To run it, click a square, and follow the indicator for the next step

## Notes
-For now, the board is 8x8, but in knight.js file, if you edit the number n on top of the file, you can change the board size.
The same goes for canvas size.

-The number on top left of each sqaure represents the possible moves if you are in that square

-The number on the bottom right of each square represents the current value of that block, 0 if not visited, 1 if visited
